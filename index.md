## Motivation

In the past decades, methodological advancements have increased our understanding of biological process from the level of the organism down to the molecular components of the cellular machinery. Fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy are nowadays widely used to study cellular processes in real time, and provide key insights towards building a spatial, temporal and logical model of the cell as a whole.

Keeping up with the newest method developments, however, is becoming increasingly difficult due to fragmented and non-standardized software development. Many software advances are kept within the respective laboratories in in-house software packages, developed and a wide array of programming languages. Interfacing between different software packages is cumbersome due to the lack of agreed-upon exchange file formats. These factors contribute to a slow adoption of new methods by the community. Custom implementations of published algorithms are also rarely benchmarked, making the assessment of the validity of reported results difficult.

By bringing the software community of the fluorescence field together, we hope to achieve the following:

* Provide newcomers a portal that provides an overview of existing software packages, their use cases and contact information for active developers, and a forum to ask questions or request features.
* Provide software developers a platform to present their published or unpublished software packages and discuss problems with other developers.
* Increase the compatibility of existing software packages through common file exchange formats and interfaces.
* Increase the robustness of algorithms by agreeing on common standard procedures. As a long term goal, this will result in a library of algorithms that can be interfaced with different high-level programming languages.

Our vision is to provide the fluorescence microscopist and spectroscopist a bag of Legos that he or she can assemble into a custom workflow with minimal effort.
