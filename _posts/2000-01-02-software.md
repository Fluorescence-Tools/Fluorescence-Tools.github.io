## Improving the quality of scientific software

Data analysis and processing software is essential for an expanding fluorescence community.
To improve the quality of the  existing fluorescence software and to ensure that software can be used by a wide userbase, the following points have to be addressed:

* Documentation
* Correctness, Testing
* Impact and distribution
* Usability & interoperability

We aim to first gather information on existing software, classify the software and the software packages, assess the status of the software, and finally publish a **curated list** of the software packages as a reference for the community.

### 1. Gather information

Gather the software used in the fluorescence community.

### 2. Classify software

Software packages will be classified by:

* Their application (e.g. imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy,...)
* Programming languange used
* Open- or closed-source

### 3. Assess software and development status

1. Contact core developers of actively developed software
2. Identify the status of the software development: ongoing, finished, or abandoned

### 4. Publish

* interoperable software collection
* open accessible software
* Publish list of software

### Developing data exchange formats

To improve on data exchange formats, we will:

1. collect information on existing software
2. identify interfacing points in the analysis for the different use-cases
3. propose a list of needed exchange formats
