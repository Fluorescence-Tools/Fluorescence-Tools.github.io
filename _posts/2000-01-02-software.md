# Spread the word

Data analysis and processing software is essential for a strong fluorescence community.

To strengthen the fluorescence community, we plan to assess the current state of the software by 
first collecting the existing software. 

To improve on data exchange formats, we

1. need to collect information on the used existing software
2. contact core developers of actively developed software 
3. identify use finished (abandoned) software 

We already identified a fair amount of the used software. But, we don't know all the nuiances
of the software used in your lab. Hence, for a complete list


*We need your input!*

Hence,

* please check if a software you use is not listed in the software list
* register unlisted software using the registration form below.
