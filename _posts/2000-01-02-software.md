# Improve software quality

Data analysis and processing software is essential for a strong fluorescence community.
Our mission is to improve the quality of the used existing fluorescence software. 

This includes:

* Documentation
* Correctness
* Impact and distribution
* Usability & interoperability

To achieve this goal, we first (1) gather information on existing software,  
(2) classify the software and the software packages, (3) assess the status of the 
software, (4) and finally publish a list of the software packages. 

## 1. Gather information

To improve the software quality, we first need to gather the software used in the fluorescence community.

## 2. Classify software

Software packages will be classified by:

* Their application (e.g. imaging, single-molecule spectroscopy,...)
* Programming languange used
* Open- or closed-source

## 3. Assess software and development status

1. contact core developers of actively developed software 
2. identify the status of the software development: ongoing, finished, or abandoned

## 4. Publish

* interoperable software collection
* open accessible software
* Publish list of software

# Improve data exchange formats

To improve on data exchange formats, we will:

1. collect information on the used existing software
2. identify interfacing points in the analysis for the different use-cases
3. propose a list of needed exchange formats
