# Collect

Data analysis and processing software is essential for a strong fluorescence community.

To strengthen the fluorescence community, we plan to assess the current state of the software by 
first collecting the existing software. 

To improve on data exchange formats, we

1. need to collect information on the used existing software
2. contact core developers of actively developed software 
3. identify use finished (abandoned) software 

# Publish

* Publish list of software
