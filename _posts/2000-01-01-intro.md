# Motivation
{: .text-purple}


Fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy are nowadays widely used to study cellular processes in real time, 
and provide key insights towards building a spatial, temporal and logical model of the cell as a whole.

However,
1. Keeping up with the newest method developments in fluorescence spectroscopy is becoming increasingly 
difficult due to fragmented and non-standardized software development. 

2. Interfacing between different software packages is cumbersome due to the lack of agreed-upon exchange file formats. 

3. Custom implementations of published algorithms are also rarely benchmarked, making the 
assessment of the validity of reported results difficult.


By bringing the software community of the fluorescence field together, we hope to:

* Provide newcomers an overview of existing software packages, their use cases and contact information for active 
developers, and a forum to ask questions or request features.
* Provide software developers a platform to present their software packages and discuss problems with other developers.
* Increase the compatibility of existing software packages through common file exchange formats and interfaces.
* Increase the robustness of algorithms by agreeing on common standard procedures.

Our vision is to provide the fluorescence microscopist and spectroscopist a bag of Legos that he or she can assemble 
into a custom workflow with minimal effort.
